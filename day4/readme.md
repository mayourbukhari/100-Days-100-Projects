### Description:

For Day 4 of the 100 Days 100 Projects Challenge, I developed a Text To Speech Converter using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project enables users to input text and have it converted into speech.

### Project Details:

- **HTML**: Defines the structure of the web page, including input fields and buttons.
- **CSS**: Styles the appearance of the Text To Speech Converter interface.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the functionality to convert text to speech using the Web Speech API.

### How to Use:

Simply enter the text you want to convert into speech in the input field and click the "Convert" button. The converted speech will be played back to you.
